# CSC 207 (Fall 2016) Homework 2: Speed Reader

Members: Yuyin Sun, Linh Pham
Our project includes 3 classes, WordGenerator which reads the text from file, DrawingPanel which 
provides library function for animating the rendering text process and SpeedReader which 
renders and animates the text to the screen.

We use StackOverflow to find function that converts String to integer

Got help from CS Tutor on how to clear the Graphics Window and run the DrawingPanel library

Extra Credit Implemented: Centering the text and Focusing by Coloring the character based on the
length of the word.
